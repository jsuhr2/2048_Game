2048 style game where colors are swiped instead of number tiles, starting with black tiles and progressing to more colorful ones. 2 black tiles are generated randomly on the grid at the start of the game with a new one being generated with every swipe. Loss occurs when no more moves are possible and win occurs when the yellow tile is reached. Game implements swipe gestures as well as alerts for win/loss mechanism. Each tile was created using UIView's which allow them to change color individually. On a win or loss the game displays the appropriate alert and then restarts the game with a clear board. There is also an option to restart the game manually with the "Start/Reset" button.
